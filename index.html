      <strong>Cr&acirc;nes Ado</strong>: a little zine for print and tablets about average folk who make and play their own games. Video games, board games, physical games, mind games. Informal and abstract, Cr&acirc;nes Ado itself is a game of the artistic expression of sets of rules and the experience of play.
